<h1>This is a project known as Advanced Number Plate Recognition System.</h1>
<p>In this project I used power of OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, imutils to make a system which can extract number from the number plate provided the raw files are either in audio or video.
<br>The code file for testing for the image is named as imagecode and the test file is image.<br>The code file for testing the video is named as videocode and the test file is named as video.<br>
The result for the video is given in the repo by the name of out.</p>
